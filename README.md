# MeanApp
Hi LFCT folk, here's an app that I made.

Make sure you have at least node version 4 and npm version 3 before installing

You can install it with `npm install` and run it with `npm start` then the server should be running on `http://localhost:3000`

I used this tutorial to make it [making a mean app](https://scotch.io/tutorials/mean-app-with-angular-2-and-the-angular-cli)

You'll also want to install the angular-cli globally, so run `sudo npm install -g angular-cli`

The FB-api might not work for you... in which case send me a message and we'll figure it out.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.22-1.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This server is purely the frontend of the app, which is useful for debugging. 

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.

## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng --help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
